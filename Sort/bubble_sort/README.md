# Bubble Sort

* Bubble Sort is a common way to sort something.
* Generally, we put the biggest element to the top, means of the rightmost side of the array.

# How to implement

## Divide and Conquer

* Start looping from with a varaible called i the end of the array towards the beginning
* Start an inner loop with a varaiable called j from the beginning until i - 1
* If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!
* Return the sorted array

# time complexity
