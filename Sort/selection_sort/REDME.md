# Selection Sort

* Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position (in general, we put the smallest value to first position.)

# How to implement

* Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
* Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
* If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimun" and contiune until the end of the array.
* If the "minimun" if not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
* Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
